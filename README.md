# Identifying Misinformation in News Articles Using NLP and Machine Learning
## Project Overview

Our project is titled "Identifying Misinformation in News Articles Using NLP and Machine Learning." We aim to use natural language processing techniques and machine learning models to build a system that can detect and classify fake news articles. We'll preprocess news data and apply machine learning models to classify articles as real or fake, with plans to deploy the model as a web application for user interaction


## Introduction

In today's world, where we use the internet and social media a lot, there's a ton of information being shared all the time. But sometimes, this information isn't accurate, and that can cause problems. Fake news spreads quickly, and it can change how people think and talk about things. To stop this from happening, we can use special computer techniques like Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. By combining these methods, we can better understand and predict what's true and what's not, helping us tackle this problem more effectively.

ML models have great ability to analyze the data and make the predictions with accurate percentage output. This huge amount of dataflow is controlled by using different enhanced tools and softwares. To find the news is fake and true we need to understand the human language of words where the data should align in this dimensions which will increase the accuracy rate of the NLP algorithms.

The goal of this project is to establish a link between data and human understanding, aiding in the determination of whether data is genuine or false. The dataset employed for training purposes will familiarize the system with commonly used patterns and address missing information. Through an iterative process, the approach is fine-tuned and evaluated on the dataset, resulting in the development of an accurate model that fosters trust by eliminating fake news. The objective is to enhance the accuracy of information in digital media.
