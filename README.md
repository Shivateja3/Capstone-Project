# Identifying Misinformation in News Articles Using NLP and Machine Learning
## Project Overview

Our project is titled "Identifying Misinformation in News Articles Using NLP and Machine Learning." We aim to use natural language processing techniques and machine learning models to build a system that can detect and classify fake news articles. We'll preprocess news data and apply machine learning models to classify articles as real or fake, with plans to deploy the model as a web application for user interaction


## Introduction

In todayâ€™s rapidly evolving digital landscape, the proliferation of fake news poses a significant threat to public trust, democratic processes, and social cohesion. Fake news, defined as deliberately misleading or false information presented as news, has the potential to cause widespread harm by manipulating public opinion and fostering misinformation. Despite efforts from human fact-checkers and media platforms, the sheer volume of information makes it impossible to manually verify every article. Additionally, current automated solutions for detecting misinformation often struggle with domain-specific nuances, context awareness, and scalability.
This project aims to develop a robust, scalable system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to detect misinformation in news articles. The proposed system will analyze textual patterns and linguistic features across a large dataset of both reliable and unreliable news sources. By leveraging NLP techniques like contextual embeddings (BERT) and machine learning models, the system will classify articles into "reliable" or "misinformation" categories. The model will address key challenges such as data imbalance, domain generalization, and the need for real-time performance in large-scale news environments.
The focus is on enhancing current methods by incorporating context-awareness and improving the accuracy of identifying subtle and complex misinformation, especially in politically charged or sensitive topics.
